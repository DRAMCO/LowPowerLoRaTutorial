# Low power wireless communication technologies for connecting embedded sensors in the IoT
## A journey from fundaments to hands-on.

## Abstract
In this hands-on session the attendees will experience the development of a wireless sensor node. More specifically, how low-power operation can be achieved by clever utilization of the available resources. Such design choices include: selecting the right wireless technology, duty-cycled operation, hardware acceleration, etc.

The participants will experiment with a custom LoRa-based sensor, built with a [Semtec SX1272](http://www.semtech.com/wireless-rf/rf-transceivers/sx1272/) Radio chip and an [EFM32 Cortex M0](https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/32-bit/efm32-happy-gecko) processor. The way operations are being performed on the node can be customized in the [Silabs Simplicity Studio IDE](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio). The effect of these changes on the energy consumption can be observed through the IDE’s built-in energy profiler.

In the end, the lecturers will have shown that the design of true low-power wireless sensors requires a thoughtful design. Both software and hardware need to work seamlessly together within the boundaries of a specific application.
